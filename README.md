StatelessPrime

StatelessPrime code repository


A week after the announcement of Çagatay Çivici of the joint development of PrimeUI and AngularPrime on Github, he one-sided and without consultation removed the code from GitHub and announced his own integration between PrimeUI and AngularJS.

As I can't compete with his resources, I decided, with pain in my heart, to stop the development of AngularPrime.
